# Privacy Policy for CounterPhish

Last updated: 12/07/2024

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At CounterPhish, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your browsing experience. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices concerning the collection, use, and protection of your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Do Not Collect

CounterPhish is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be clear about what we do not do:

- We do not collect any personal information.
- We do not track your browsing history.
- We do not store or transmit the content of the web pages you visit.
- We do not sell or share any user data with third parties.

## Information We Do Collect

The only information CounterPhish collects and stores is:

1. **User-defined whitelists and blacklists**: These are domains you choose to trust or block.
2. **Removed domains**: A list of domains you've chosen to remove from our default lists.

This information is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API and, if you're signed into Chrome, may be synced across your devices for a consistent experience.

## How We Use Information

The information stored (your custom lists) is used solely for the functioning of the extension:

- To check if a website you're visiting is on your whitelist or blacklist.
- To maintain your personalized security settings across your devices.

## Data Storage and Security

All data is stored locally on your device or in your personal Chrome sync account. We do not have access to this data, nor is it transmitted to any external servers.

## Updates to Lists

Our base whitelist and blacklist are updated only when the extension itself is updated through the Chrome Web Store. These updates do not affect your personal customizations.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access your stored data (which is all local to your device)
- Modify your whitelists and blacklists at any time
- Delete all stored data by uninstalling the extension
